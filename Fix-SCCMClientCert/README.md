## Overview

This script is designed to remediate SCCM (Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager) client communication issues caused by corrupt or missing client certificates.

It safely removes the cryptographic keys from the `MachineKeys` folder after taking ownership, allowing the SCCM client to regenerate a new self-signed certificate and resume communication with the Management Point (MP).
